# 1-tribute-page

This is a tribute page project created for www.freecodecamp.org Responsive Web Design coursework. I am also learning to use terminal and github. 

This is my first project, so I am making a ton of changes. In fact, after many days of change, add, commit, delete. I am adding this to GitHub again, fresh. I will likely have a ton of changes ahead, but it was getting too messy to navigate. I can see why it's important to keep your working directory clean. LSS
